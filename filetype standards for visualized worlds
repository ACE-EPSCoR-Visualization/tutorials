File Type Standards and Guidelines for VTL Worlds

**3D Application Export - .FBX**

.FBX is a standard file type capable of exporting many types of content from nearly any 3D modelling program, with maximum compatibility with Unity. Additionally, .FBX files reduce streamlines workflow by embedding and object’s animations, textures, and geometry into one file, and maintaining their interconnectivity on import. 

**Textures – .PSD, .PNG**

Textures should be saved in duplicate. One file should be a high resolution source saved as a .PSD, and the file should be a working copy saved as a lossless .PNG. 

The reason for having two files is that image fidelity is a one way stream. After reducing resolution for runtime efficiency, the higher resolution is lost.  As a consequence, a source image is required as a master copy for future changes to the texture.

The .PNG working file needs to be saved in a lossless configuration as Unity will compress the image at runtime. Adding compression when saving is thus rendered redundant and negatively affects performance.

All textures should be square and have their resolution saved as a power of two, i.e. 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024, etc.

**Audio – .WAV, .OGG or .MP3**

For short audio clips a native audio format, such as .WAV, works best as there is no runtime process to decode the audio. File sizes will be larger as compared to a compressed format, but overall runtime efficiency is higher.
 
Long audio clips should use a compressed data format. Either and Ogg Vorbis or .MP3 file type is suitable. It should be noted these file types are ideal for a Windows, Mac, Linux, or Standalone build. The sound will have to be re-encoded for Mobile builds resulting in a small loss of fidelity.

**Heightmaps – RAW**

Unity will only accept a grayscale RAW file as a heightmap. Adobe Photoshop is capable of exporting an image into a RAW file. It is important to note that RAW is distinct from .RAW data, which is a format used by cameras to store unedited picture data and is not usable for heightmap purposes.

Information on how to convert .DEM data into a Heightmap can be found in our tutorial titled Introduction to Ecosystem Virtualization: Navigating Unity and Preparing the Environment.
